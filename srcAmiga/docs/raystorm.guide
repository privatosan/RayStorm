@node Introduction " Introduction "
@{b}INTRODUCTION@{ub}

This document describes the raytracing package RayStorm. The package consists
of two parts:
- The scene modeler @{b}Scenario@{ub} which is the graphical user interface
  (GUI) of the RayStorm package.
- The script interface @{b}RayStorm Script@{ub}, a program wich allowes one
  to use the raytracer through a script language.
- The heart of RayStorm: @{b}RayStorm Raytracer@{ub}, wich generates the
  picture from a scene description (this part is not visible to the user
  but nevertheless it's the main part).

Here are some additional informations to the parts:

  @{"RayStorm Scenario" link Intro_Scenario}
  @{"RayStorm Script" link Intro_Script}
  @{"RayStorm Raytracer" link Intro_Raytracer}
@endnode

@node Intro_Scenario " Introduction to Scenario "
@{b}INTRODUCTION TO SCENARIO@{ub}

As we developed Scenario we tried to make the user interface to use as
easy as possible to enable even absolute beginners to work with it. Therefore
almost all actions can be performed with the mouse. For advanced users we
implemented keyboard shortcuts for almost all functions.

Scenario can load a project at startup. For this start it with the name of a
directory as argument or from Workbench by selecting the project drawer and
double clicking the Scenario icon.

A detailed introduction can be found @{"here" link Scenario_Usage}.
@endnode

@node Intro_Script " Introduction to RayStorm Script "
@{b}INTRODUCTION TO RAYSTORM SCRIPT@{ub}

The script language that contains the description of the scene is easy to
learn and offers some powerful capabilities. In addition, the script language
has a full support for key frame animation.

A RayStorm script file (.ray files) is basically divided into the following
sections:
- Various settings of the camera, the world and the lights,
- Definitions of the different textured surfaces,
- Different actors that set the Motion Blur and animation parameters,
- Objects that are associated with surfaces and actors
- Settings for the final rendered graphic.

For a more detailed description click @{"here" link ARexx}.
@endnode

@node Intro_Raytracer " Introduction to RayStorm Raytracer "
@{b}INTRODUCTION TO RAYSTORM RAYTRACER@{ub}

The raytracer itself is a part to RayStorm which is not directly visible.
All features of the raytracer are packed into a shared library. Both Scenario
and RayStorm Script use this library to render their scenes.

The raytracer is based on a fast octree algorithm. It has some powerfull
features such as @{"Motion Blur" link Motion_Blur}, @{"Soft Shadows" link SoftShadows} and
@{"Depth of Field" link DOF}.
@endnode

@node RayGeneral " General "
@{b}GENERAL@{ub}

Raytracing makes it possible to generate fotorealistic pictures of objects.

A raytracer casts a ray form the position of the viewer through a scene
and calculates possible intersections with the objects in that scene. If an
intersection is found, the raytracer decides which color the object
at this position has. If the object is reflective or transparent, the
raytracer casts new rays from this positon and tests the intersections
again and so on.

To make the surfaces of the objects more realistic, textures which
simulate marble, wood other surfaces can be used.
@endnode

@node Octree " Octree "
@{b}OCTREE@{ub}
Simple raytracers determine the intersections with objects by testing all
objects. This can lead to long rendering times if there are a lot of
objects in the scene.

One solution of this problem is the Octree algorithm.
This algorithm divides the scene into eight child-cells recursively until
there is less than oe object in the cell or the maximum depth of the tree is reached.

Division of space with the octree algorithm:
             _
             /| z
            /
     /-------/-------/|
 ^ y/       /       / |

 |---------------|/-->
@endnode

@node Antialiasing " Antialiasing "
@{b}ANTIALIASING@{ub}

RayStorm uses a algorithm called 'Adaptive Supersampling' to do antialiasing.
For each pixel with a high contrast against its four neighbours, the algorithm
casts new rays which are close to the ray used for the pixel itself. The new
color of the pixel is calculated with the supersampled pixels and the gaussian
filter.

Supersampling is also used to do @{"depth of field" link DOF} and @{"soft shadows" link SoftShadows}. So if
you want to use this features you have to set a antialiasing value greater
than one. (-> @{"ANTIALIAS" link ANTIALIAS})

Example:
Settings: squareroot of number of samples per pixel: 3

|--------|--------|--------|
| super- | super- | super- |
| sampled| sampled| sampled|
|        |        |        |
|--------|--------|--------|
| super- |        | super- |
| sampled| pixel  | sampled|
|        |        |        |
|--------|--------|--------|
| super- | super- | super- |
| sampled| sampled| sampled|
|        |        |        |
|--------|--------|--------|

|- Gaussian filter width  -|

The rendering time increases dramatically if you use antialiasing. The
values below depend on the contrast of the picture.

Samplesetting     rendering time
                  average case     worst case
1                 x1                x1
2                 x2                x4
3                 x4                x8
4                 x8               x16
...               ...              ...

Setting higher than 3 are not leading to significant better results.
@endnode

@node DOF " Depth of field "
@{b}DEPTH OF FIELD@{ub}

Objects in computer graphics are normally rendered in an image plane
using a pinhole camera model. That is to say, no matter how far or how
near the objects are from the camera, they are always in sharp focus.
Depth of field means that only objects at a certain distance from the
camera lens are in sharp focus. Further and nearer objects produce a
blurred image on the film plane.

[From 'Advanced Animation and Rendering Techniques']

To use depth of field you have to set @{"ANTIALIAS" link ANTIALIAS} to a value bigger
than one.

@{"Example for DOF" link "pics/dof.iff/main" 0}
@endnode

@node SoftShadows " Soft shadows "
@{b}SOFT SHADOWS@{ub}

Real Light sources never have a zero size, therefore the shadows behind
objects are never hard edged, they are soft. RayStorm generates this
shadows by jittering the position of the light source. To use soft shadows
you must set @{"DISTRIB" link DISTRIB} to a value bigger than one.
@endnode

@node InfoShadowMap " Shadow map "
@{b}SHADOW MAP@{ub}
A shadow map is a depth map with the light source in the center. If a ray
hits an object the distance between this hit point is calculated and compared
with the depth found in the shadow map. If distance from the hitpoint is
less than the value in the depth map, the object is in shadow.

The problem with this concept is that transparent objects cast dark shadows.
For example a green glas sphere which is illumated with a lightsource without
shadow map will cast a green shadow, with shadowmap the shadow will be black.

Because of limitiations of the memory all depth values in all possible
directions can't be stored. Therefore the strength of the shadow is interpolated,
and the shadow is not sharp like the normal calculated shadow.

The shadowmap is calculated in spherical coordinates, this means for a size
of the shadowmap of 128 RayStorm calculates 128x64=8192 samples. For each sample
on float value (4 bytes) is stored. This means that a shadow map with size 128
needs 128x64x4=32768 bytes of memory. Note that @{b}every@{ub} light source
with shadow map enabled needs its own shadowmap.
@endnode

@node Motion_Blur " Motion Blur "
@{b}MOTION BLUR@{ub}

Motion blur is temporal anti-aliasing. In animated sequences, the normal
rendering process functions like a camera that possesses an infinitely
short exposure time and this eliminates the blurring of the image due
to relative motion between an object and the film plane. When a series of
images, generated without motion blur, is displayed as an animated
sequence, the illusion of smooth motion is diminished by strobing effects.
As human beings we expect to see loss of detail in moving images.

Motion blur is accounted for in distributed ray tracing by extending the
distributed sampling and jittering into the time domain and computing a
solution that extracts information from the scen over the duration of the
shutter exposure time. Objects are moved as required in the time period
and visibility consequently changes over this time intervall. This method
ensures that highlights and shadows are blurred or not, depending on the
nature of the motion.

[From '@{"Advanced Animation and Rendering Techniques" link Literature}']
@endnode

@node Surface " Surfaces "
@{b}SURFACES@{ub}

Ambient (set with AMBIENT)

This determines the color of the object in sections which are in shadow.

Diffuse reflection (set with DIFFUSE)

The diffuse reflection falls off as the cosine of the angle between
the normal and the ray to the light. Diffuse reflection determines the
main color of the object (color in Imagine).

Specularly reflected highlights (set with SPECULAR)

Specularly reflected highlights fall off as the cosine of the angle
between the reflected ray and the ray to the light source (specular in
Imagine)

Specular reflection exponent (set with REFEXP)

Determines the size of the specularly reflected highlights, the higher
the smaller the highlight (hardness in Imagine)

Diffuse transmission (set with DIFFTRANS)

Same as diffuse reflection, but only used if the lightsource is on
opposite side of surface. Only applied if tranlucency is not 0.

Specular transmission (set with SPECTRANS)

Same as specular reflection, but only used if the lightsource is on
opposite side of surface. Only applied if tranlucency is not 0.

Specular transmission exponent (set with TRANSEXP)

Same as specular reflection exponent, but only used if the lightsource
is on opposite side of surface.

Specular transmittance (set with TRANSLUC)

Specular transmittance.

Transparency (set with TRANSPAR)

Transparent color (filter in Imagine).

Reflectivity (set with REFLECT)

Reflective color (reflect in Imagine).

Fog length (set with FOGLEN) (fog in Imagine).

Index of refraction (set with REFRINDEX)

Determines how the ray through transparent objects is refracted, the higher
the more (index of refraction in Imagine).
Is calculated with the formula

            lightspeed in vacuum
   index = ----------------------
            lightspeed in object    .
@endnode

@node InfoCSG " CSG "
@{b}CSG@{ub}

The idea of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is to combine to or more
primitives with logical operations to produes a new shape. The operations
needed for CSG are union, intersection, and difference.

With the intersection operator you can combine two objects, and the new shape
consists of all points which are inside the first @{b}and@{ub} the second
object. Points inside one of the objects, but not the other are not part of the
shape.

If you combine two objects with the union operator, the new shape consists
of all points which are inside either the first or the second object, or
inside both objects.

With the difference operator you can cut out a piece of an object with another
object. The first object is the object that is being 'cut' by the second
object.
@endnode

@node InfoHyperTexture " Hyper texture "
@{b}HYPER TEXTURES@{ub}
Many objects, such as fur or woven materials, have a complex definition which
is at best awkward, and at worst impossible, to discribe by a surface model.
For other objects, such as eroded materials or fluids, a highly complex
boundary is actually an arifact of a process hat is often more readily
describet volumetrically. Still other objects, such as flame, clouds, or smoke,
don't actually hav a well defined boundary surface at all.

Hyper textures consist of a base-shape which have a hard region where they are
completely solid, and a soft region where they are indeterminate. Whenever we
are in the soft region, we can apply a toolkit of shaping functions, allowing
the flexibility to create and manipulate volumetric form.
[From: '@{"Hypertexture" link Literature}']
@endnode

@node InfoSOR " Surface of revolution"
@{b}SURFACE OF REVOLUTION@{ub}

For surfaces of revolution (SOR) objects a curve is rotated around a axis. This
curve describes the dependence of the radius from the position of the axis. The
curve is described by two-dimensional vectors consisting of the radius and the
corresponding height. These points are smoothly connected and rotated about the
y-axis. The first and the last points are only used to determine the slopes of
the function at the start and end point. To any given point on the rotation axis
belongs at most one function value. You can't rotate closed curves.

SOR is based on the work of Peter Bruger and Duncan Gillies in their book
@{"Interactive Computer Graphics" link Literature}. If you want to know more about the mathematical
background you can find it there.

@node VirtualMemory " Virtual Memory "
@{b}VIRTUAL MEMORY@{ub}

RayStorm has been succesfully tested with VMM 3.1 from Martin Apel. If you
want use RayStorm with virtual memory notice follwing hints:

- set Minimum VM allocation to 100 bytes if you define large scenes with
  many objects, because RayStorm only allocates small pieces of memory for
  single objects (less then 200 bytes). If you're loading external objects
  RayStorm allocates big blocks of memory so you don't have to set Minimum
  VM allocation to 100.
- use a partition or a pseudo-partition for VMM, this is faster

@node Scenario_Usage " Scenario Usage "
@{b}USAGE@{ub}

After you have started Scenario you see the worksheet.

At the top of the sheet are the buttons to manage projects, to control the
mesh editing modes, the view mode, the display mode, the edit mode, enable
the selection box and to control the currently active directions.

Below this button bar is the work area. It is devided in three sections: the
draw area, the browser section and the material manager. At startup you can
see a grid and the camera in the middle of the draw area (note: there must
always remain at least one camera in the scene). In the @{"browser section" link Scenario_Browser} you
can see all objects of the scene, in a new scene there is only the camera.
The objects can be sorted by drag and drop. The @{"material manager" link Scenario_Material} helps you
to handle the different material in the scene. In a new scene there is no
material defined.

At the bottom of the window is a status bar which displays the name of the
selected object (if more than one object is selected, the name of the first
object is displayed), the name of the active camera and the current cursor
coordinates if the coordinate display is enabled (see @{"Show Coordinates" link Menu_View_ShowCoordinates}).

All objects, cameras and light sources have an axis to handle it. The axis
consist of a rectangular area - the hot spot or handle - and three lines
which show the orientation of the axis. The axis can be selected by clicking
with the left mouse button at the handle. If it is selected the color of
the axis and the object changes.

Clicking with the left mouse button invokes the modify mode. According to the
slected mode (move, rotate or scale) the world or the selected object(s) can
be modified.

Clicking with the right mouse button open object specific menus (see
@{"Object Menus" link Object_Menus}).

Scenario also has a ARexx port, for a more detailed description click @{"here" link Scenario_ARexx}.

@node Scenario_Browser " Browser "
@{b}OBJECT BROWSER@{ub}

The object browser helps you to manage the objects in your scene. With
it you can select objects, change the hierarchy of a scene and you have
access to the object menus. One browser line is divided in four parts:
- the tree handles
- a little image which indicates the type of the object (@{"here" link "pics/browser_all.iff/main" 0} are all
  images)
- the object name
- a thumbnail image which shows the material, which is assigned to the
  object
@{"Here" link "pics/browser.iff/main" 0} you can see a example for the contents of the object browser.

The hierachiy of the objects can be changed by drag and drop. For this
click with the left mouse buton on an object, and hold the mouse button
down. Now the browser entry is attached to the pointer and you can move
the object. If you move the pointer over another entry in the browser one
or more dotted lines indicates where the dragged object is dropped. A
line above the browser entry indicates that the dragged object is inserted
above the browser entry. Two lines, one above and one below indicates that
the dragged object is inserted as a child of the browser entry. A line
below the browser entry indicates that the object is inserted below the
browser entry.

@node Scenario_Material " Material manager "
@{b}Material Manager@{ub}

The material manager helps you to manage the materials of the scene. Although
the material manager is empty in new scene, one material is already defined.
This material is assigned to all new created objects and can not be changed.

A new material is created by pressing the right mouse button in the material
manager area, and selecting 'New' from the menu, or by selecting 'New' from
the 'Material' menu. This menu contains the following points:
- New:                   creates a new material.
- Load new...:           opens a file requester to select a material file,
                         creates a new material and loads the material data
                         and assigns it to the new created material.
- Remove unused:         removes all materials which are not assigned to an
                         object.
- Remove identical:      removes all materials which are double. This is
                         useful if you have loaded external objects with
                         many identical materials.

If you press the right mouse button over a material item another menu opens:
- New: creates a new material
- Load...:               loads the material data from a material file to the
                         current material.
- Save...:               saves the material data to a material file.
- Delete:                deletes the material.
- Properties...:         opens the material requester for this material.
- Assign to selected...: assigns the material to the currently selected
                         objects.

To assign a material to an object press the left mouse button over a material,
hold it down, drag it to an object in the object browser and release the button.

If you double click a material the material settings requester is opened.

You can change the name of the material by editing the name string on the
buttom of the material item.

@node Menu_Project_RenderSettings " Render Settings Project Menu "
@{b}RENDER SETTINGS@{ub}

Opens the render settings requester. The requester is divides in three pages.
On the @{"first page" link "pics/render1.iff/main" 0} you can select predefined render resolutions with a listview
or enter the values to numeric fields. The values range from 0 to 65535.
The resolution presets can be defined in a file named 'prefs/res.dat'. This file
is a text file which can be edited with a text editor. The format of this file is:
@{b}<name>,<resolution in x direction>,<resolution in y direction>@{ub}.
A example for the contents of this file is:
@{i}PAL 160x128,160,128
NTSC 160x120,160,120@{ui}
On this page you also can also enable the rendering field. RayStorm renders
only inside this field. The field is shown in the perspective window if camera
view is switched on.
On the @{"second page" link "pics/render2.iff/main" 0} are settings which affect the rendering process. The 'Quick'
flag selects the quick rendering mode. In this mode RayStorm don't calculates
shadows, transparency or reflections.
The 'Octree depth' slider sets the maximum depth of the octree which RayStorm
uses. For almost all scenes a vlaue of three is the best, but in complex scenes
it may be better to use higher values. The higher this value is the longer
takes the initialazion phase and the more memory is needed.
The 'Min. Objects' slider sets the amount of objects upto which no octree is
generated. If ther is a small amount of objects in the scene it's sometimes
better not to build the octree due to the overhead of the intersection test.
This value depends on your scene, for about 3 to 5 objects it's better not
to use the octree. But if you want to render scenes with motion blur it's
better to set this value to zero because this is faster.
Ont the @{"third page" link "pics/render3.iff/main" 0} are output related gadgets.
The 'Filename' string gadget sets the filename of the generated picture and the
cycle gadget sets the fileformat. You can show the rendered picture with the
view button (the camera left to the filename).
The 'Show' flag enables the direct showing of the picture while the
render process is running (needs KS 3.0 or better).
The 'Ok' button closes the requester and stores the current settings, whereas
the 'Cancel' button don't change the settings.

@node Menu_View_Global " View Global Menu "
@{b}Global@{ub}

Opens the global settings requester. Here you can change the global scene
settings. The requester is divided in two pages.

On the @{"first page" link "pics/setglobal1.iff/main" 0} you can set enviroment values.
The 'Background' colorfield sets the color of the background of the rendered
picture.
The 'Ambient' colorfield sets color of the ambient light which is the base
brightness of all objects. In other words: surfaces which are not illuminated
by a light source get the ambient color.
With the 'Backdrop' string gadget you can enter a picture which will replace
the background.
The 'Reflectionmap' string gadget sets the name of a picture which will be
reflected by objects instead of the background. The reflectionmap is even
applied in quick mode.
The global fog parameters are controlled with the gadgets of the next group.
'Length' sets the thickness of the fog. The 'Color' colorfield determines the
color of the fog. 'Height' sets the height at which the fog ends. Global fog
always starts at negative infinity in y direction and and at the specified y
position.

The @{"next page" link "pics/setglobal2.iff/main" 0} of gadgets sets the @{"antialiasing" link Antialiasing} parameters. The
antialiasing value ranges from 2x2 (low antialiasing) to 8x8 (very high
antialiasing). This slider sets the amount of rays per pixel. 2x2 means that
there are 4 rays casted per pixel. Filter width sets the maximum distance from
the main ray to the additional generated rays in pixels. The 'Contrast'
colorfield sets the minimum contrast. If the contrast of the main pixel against
its four neighbours is higher than this color, RayStorm performs antialiasing
at this pixel. For more information about antialiasing click @{"here" link Antialiasing}.
The last group controls soft shadows. The 'Softshadow' cyle gadget sets the level
of oversampling (additional casted rays) for soft shadows. Soft shadows are caused
from light sources with a size bigger than 0. For more information about soft
shadows click @{"here" link Softshadows}. The 'Random jitter' flag switches between normal
and random sampling. With random sampling the sampling position is calculated
randomly.
@endnode

@node Menu_View_Browser " View Browser Menu "
@{b}BROWSER@{ub}

Switches the object browser on/off.
@endnode

@node Menu_View_Material " View Material manager Menu "
@{b}MATERIAL MANAGER@{ub}

Switches the material manager on/off.
@endnode

@node Menu_Object_Attributes " Object Attributes Menu "
@{b}ATTRIBUTES@{ub}

Opens the attribute requester for the currently selected object, if no object
is selected no requester is opened.
Here you can set the parameters which determine the apperance of the surface.
The requester is divided into three groups:
- @{"Surface" link "pics/attr.iff/main" 0}
  At this page you can set the base apperance of the surface.
  - Diffuse
    The diffuse reflection falls off as the cosine of the angle between
    the normal and the ray to the light. Diffuse reflection determines
    the main color of the object.
  - Ambient
    This determines the color of the object in sections which are in
    shadow.
  - Specular
    Specularly reflected highlights fall off as the cosine of the angle
    between the reflected ray and the ray to the light source.
  - Diffuse Transmission
    Same as diffuse reflection, but only used if the lightsource is on
    opposite side of surface. Only applied if tranlucency is not 0.
  - Transparence
    Transparent color.
  - Specular Transmission
    Same as specular reflection, but only used if the lightsource is on
    opposite side of surface. Only applied if tranlucency is not 0.
  - Reflectivity
    Reflective color.
  - Translucency
    Specular transmittance.
  - Reflection exponent
    Determines the size of the specularly reflected highlights, the higher
    the smaller the highlight.
  - Index of refraction
    Determines how the ray through transparent objects is refracted, the
    higher the more.
  - Transmission exponent
    Same as specular reflection exponent, but only used if the lightsource
    is on opposite side of surface.
  - Fog length
  - Bright
    The brightness of the surface is everywhere the same. Light sources don't
    affect the surface, no shadows are visible on the surface, but the object
    casts shadows.
- @{"Brush" link "pics/attr1.iff/main" 0}
  Brushes are pictures which are projected to the surface. They can replace
  different surface parameters as color, transparency, reflectivity and
  specularity. Additional with altitude mapping brushes can change the normals
  of the surface to simulate bumps or other structures which go 'in' or come
  'out' of the surface.
  There are three wrap methods available:
  - flat (Flat)
    The brush is projected to X-Y plane.
  - cylindrical around x- or y-axis (WrapX and WrapY)
    The brush is wrapped around the x or y-axis, like on a cylinder. The left
    edge of the brush begins at the posititve x-axis and wraps the brush around
    the cylinder from 'west' to 'east'.
  - spherical (WrapXY)
    Wrapping both: around x- and y-axis. It is assumed, that the object is a
    sphere. The y-axis is the north/south pole of the spherical mapping. The
    left edge of the brush begins at the positive x-axis and wraps the brush
    around the sphere from 'west' to 'east'. The brush covers the sphere
    exactly once.
  Additional brushes can be repeated and mirrored (only for flat or cylindrical
  mapping). If 'Soft' is selected, the color between two points of the brush is
  softly interpolated.
  RayStorm has integrated loader modules for IFF-ILBM, Targa, JPEG and PNG pictures.
  Also Datatypes (including the new 24 bit versions) are supported, so you can
  load nearly each picture format.
  The position, alignment and size of the brush can be set if you enable the
  @{"show brushes" link Menu_View_ShowBrushes} menu item.
- @{"Texture" link "pics/attr2.iff/main" 0}
  Textures are mathematical generated patterns. Textures can change color,
  reflectivity, transparency and normals of a surface. Textures are controlled
  with a set of 16 parameters.
  The position, alignment and size of the texture can be set if you enable the
  @{"show textures" link Menu_View_ShowTextures} menu item.

@{b}Preview@{ub}
  Renders a preview of the surface on a sphere (only for KS 3.0 and better).
  The light source is always placed right top before the sphere.
  All surface attributes can be viewed here except brushes and fog.
  If reflectivity is set the RayStorm logo is reflected on the surface.
@{b}Save@{ub}
  Saves the surface data.
@{b}Load@{ub}
  Loads surface data.
@endnode

@node Menu_Object_Settings " Object Settings Menu "
@{b}Settings@{ub}

Opens the @{"settings requester" link "pics/translate.iff/main" 0} for the currently selected object.
On the first page you can set the name, track, invert CSG flag, position, alignment
and size of an object.
With @{i}Track@{ui} you can set the name of an object the object will track to.
This means that the object will always point with it's z direction to the axis
of the track object.
If the object can be used for CSG then you can invert it with the invert CSG
flag.

With the second page you can change object settings. The contents of
this page depends on the object type.

@{i}Color@{ui} sets the color of the light source.

@{i}Falloff@{ui} is the distance where the intensity of the light source is

If @{i}Falloff from track distance@{ui} is set, Scenario sets the falloff
distance to the distance to the track. This option is only selectable if the
light source is tracking to another object.

@{i}Opening angle@{ui} sets the opening angle of a spotlightsource in degree.

@{i}Soft Spot %@{ui} is a value that determines how big the area is where the
light intensity of the spot light gradually gets lower. A value of 100 % means
that the whole area which is lit by the spot light receives the full light
intensity. 50 % means for example that there is full intensity from the center
of the spot to 50 % of the opening angle and then the intensity gets lower and

@node Light_LensFlares " Lens Flares "
@{b}LENS FLARES@{ub}

With the @{"lens flare settings" link "pics/setlight2.iff/main" 0} you can create and change lens flares.

Lens flares only appear when the light source is visible. They appear on an
axis which runs from the center of the light source through the center of the
screen. The position of the flare is relative to the light source it belongs
to. If the position value is zero, the flare appears at the position of the
light source. Higher values of position move it towards the center of the
screen.
Here are some example values and their meaning:

   0 : flare has the same position as the light source
 100 : flare is in the middle of the screen
 200 : flare is on opposite side of the light source

You can also set position to negative values, so the flare will appear behind
the light source.

The radius of the flare is relative to the horizontal render resolution.
For example: A flare with radius of 20 % renderd with a resolution of 320x200
will have a radius of 0.2*320 = 64 pixels.

@{b}Type@{ub} is global to all flares and can be one of the following
identifiers:

Disc
  A flare which looks like a disc
Polygon n
  A flare which looks like a polygon. n is the number of edges.

@{b}Tilt@{ub} is also global to all flares and sets the angle the flares
are rotated.

@{b}Function@{ub} can be one of the following:

Plain
  the color of the flare is uniform
Ring
  intensity drops exponential from the border to the center
Radial
  varies the color of the flare radial around the flare center
Exponent 1
  intensity drops exponential from the border to the center
Exponent 2
  intensity drops exponential from the border to the center

The flares can either be selected by their number with the slider at top
of the requester, or in the display area of the requester by clicking with
the mouse on it.
@endnode

@node Light_VisibleLight " Visible Light "
@{b}VISIBLE LIGHT@{ub}

With the @{"visible light settings" link "pics/setlight3.iff/main" 0} you can change the appearance of the
light source.

In reality, a light source looks like a star with several spikes getting out
of the center of the light source. Usually there's a halo around it too.

The radius (length of the longest spike) of the star is relative to the
horizontal render resolution (see @{"Lens Flares" link Light_LensFlares}).

The radius of the halo is relative to the radius of the star itself. A value
of 100 % means, that the halo has the same radius as the star.
The radius of the inner halo is relative to the radius of the outer halo. A
value of 100 % means, that the inner halo has the same radius as the outer
halo.
Ring color sets the color of the halo.

The range value determines the difference between the longest and the shortes
spike of the star. A value of 0 % means that all spikes have the same length,
whereas 100 % means that the shortest spike has zero length.

The tilt angle rotates the star spikes.

The higher the noise value the more noisier the spikes are.

Intensity sets the brightness of the spikes

Color sets the color of the spikes.

@{b}How are the spikes computed ?@{ub}
The four spikes in the main directions (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) always have
maximum length. Spikes between them (45, 135, ... degrees for example) are
shorter and again spikes between them are shorter and so on.

If you enable random, the length of the spikes is randomly changed.

@{b}TIPS & TRICKS@{ub}

@{b}General@{ub}
- RayStorm renders faster if you don't use planes, because intersections
  with planes cannot be calculated with the octree (helpfull in scenes with
  motion blur or soft shadows).

@{b}Scenario@{ub}

- @{b}The 020-Version of Scenario crashes!@{ub}
  In Kickstart V40.x, there is a bug in mathieeesingbas.library - it uses FPU
  code on non-FPU machines for division/multiplication. This bug can be easily
  fixed with a patch from Aminet: @{i]util/boot/PatchMathSB10.lha@{ui}
- @{b}I have problems with the screen refresh, the scene is only refreshed
  behind the requester!@{ub}
  Open the @{"MUI-settings" link Menu_Settings_MUI} requester and select from the window
  part for "Refresh" the "Smart"-mode.
- @{b}How can I change the texture and brush names without removing and adding
  them again?@{ub}
  Select @{"View->Show->Show Textures" link Menu_View_ShowTextures} or @{"View->Show->Show Brushes" link Menu_View_ShowBrushes}
  and select the texture or brush. Now open the @{"settings-requester" link Menu_Object_Settings} and change
  the name of the brush or texture.
- @{b}How can I change the name of an RSOB/TDDD/LWOB/3DS/RAW-object without deleting
  and reloding it?@{ub}
  Select @{"Settings" link Menu_Object_Settings} from the object menu of the parent axis. Here you
  can change the name of the object.
- @{b}How can I load my old Imagine attribute files to use it for RayStorm
  objects?@{ub}
  Load the attributes file with @{"load object" link Menu_Object_Load}. You will get an axis
  named 'Mesh' with another axis attached to it. The surface of this axis is set
  to the attributes of the file. Click with the right mouse button to the parent
  axis and select @{"To scene" link Object_Menus}. The parent axis is no deleted
  and can now open the attributes requester for the child axis. Select save from
  the @{"attributes requester" link Menu_Object_Attributes} and save the surface as a RayStorm material file.
- @{b}If I apply a checker texture to a plane looks noisy!@{ub}
  If the texture is exactly on the plane, the color of the texture jumps
  between black and white because of rounding errors. Try to move the texture
  axis a little (e.g. 0.02) away from the plane.
- @{b}How can I switch on shadows?@{ub}
  You must turn off Quick Rendering in Render settings. In addition to that turn
  on cast shadows in the light settings.
- @{b}Depth of Field doesn't seem to work. I changed the aperture and the focal distance,
  but nothing happens.@{ub}
  You must increase the antialiasing value >1.

@{b}RayStorm Script@{ub}
- The commands '@{"TEXTUREPATH" link TEXTUREPATH}', '@{"OBJECTPATH" link OBJECTPATH}' and '@{"BRUSHPATH" link BRUSHPATH}' are relative
  to the directory RayStorm is started from.
- If RayStorm crashes with scenes with reflections and transparence, try
  to start RayStorm with a larger stack (e.g. 8192 bytes or more).

@{b}AREXX INTRODUCTION@{ub}

RayStorm is completly controled through it's ARexx interface. We recommend
that you have a look at the @{"tuturials" link Tutorials} and the @{"example" link Examples}
script files in the 'ARexx' directory.
These examples cover most of the features of RayStorm. Further we encourage you
to create your own files and make them available for the public. You can send
them to us and we might add them as an example files in the next version of
RayStorm or we include them to our @{"Homepage" link Homepage}.
In one of the next versions of RayStorm we'll create a more powerful
language, which has a similar syntax as C++.

It's the same if you write the the commands in upper case or lower case.
But it's important to enclose all commans in quotes because ARexx tries
to interpret the line before it sends it to the potz. It may happen that the
line is changed and RayStorm don't do what you expect.

A typical structure of a scene file is:

/* title, comments, ... */

/* setting resolution, world, camera, lightsources */
'SETSCREEN 160 128'
'SETWORLD [0,0,0] [40,40,40]'
'SETCAMERA <0,0,80> <0,0,0> <0,1,0> 25 20'
'POINTLIGHT <10,-10,100> [255,255,255] SHADOW'

/* define surfaces and actors */
'NEWSURFACE TEST1'
'AMBIENT [255,0,0]'
'DIFFUSE [255,0,0]'
'SPECULAR [255,255,255]'

'NEWSURFACE TEST2'
'AMBIENT [0,0,255]'

/* creating objects */
'SPHERE TEST1 <0,0,0> 10'
'SPHERE TEST2 <0,0,0> 10'

/* finally start to render the scene */
'STARTRENDER'

/* save the image */
'SAVEPIC "test.iff"'

 NUMBER EDGES
   Number of edges of polygonal flare (3 - 8 edges possible) (default: 5).
 FLOAT TILT
   Tilt angle of flare (only useful for polygonal flares) (default: 0).
@{b}Description:@{ub}
 A new lens flare is added to the last defined light source. Lens flares only
 appear when the light source is visible. They appear on an axis which runs
 from the center of the light source through the center of the screen. The
 position of the flare is relative to the light source it belongs to. If the
 position value is zero, the flare appears at the position of the light source.
 Greater values of pos move it towards the center of the screen. Here a some
 example values and their meaning:

   0 : flare has the same position as the light source
 100 : flare is in the middle of the screen
 200 : flare is on opposite side of the light source

 You can also set pos to negative values, so the flare will appear behind the
 light source.

 The radius of the flare is relative to the horizontal render resolution.
 For example: A flare with radius of 20 % renderd with a resolution of 320x200
 will have a radius of 0.2*320 = 64 pixels.

 @{b}type@{ub} can be one of the following identifiers:

 DISC
   A flare which looks like a disc
 POLYGON
   A flare which looks like a polygon. The number of edges can be set with
   edges.

 @{b}function@{ub} can be one of the following identifiers:

 PLAIN

 FLOAT RANGE
   Range between shortest and longest spike (in percent) (default: 0).
 NUMBER RANDOM_SEED
   Random seed value (0-32767) (default: 0).
 FLOAT TILT
   Tilt angle of spikes (in degree) (default: 0).
 FLOAT NOISE
   The higher this value the noisier the spikes (default: 5.0).
 FLOAT BRIGHTNESS
   Brightness of the spikes (default: 40.0).
 COLOR COLOR
   Color of the spikes (default: <1.0, 0.6, 0.6>).
 COLOR RINGCOLOR
   Color of the ring (defualt: <0.156, 0.0392, 0.0196>).

@{b}Description:@{ub}
 This command makes a light source visible. In reality, a light source looks
 like a star with several spikes getting out of the center of the light source.
 Usually there's a halo around it too.

 The radius (length of the longest spike) of the star is relative to the
 horizontal render resolution (see @{"FLARE" link FLARE}).

 The radius of the halo is relative to the radius of the star itself. A value
 of 100 % means, that the halo has the same radius as the star.
 The radius of the inner halo is relative to the radius of the outer halo. A
 value of 100 % means, that the inner halo has the same radius as the outer
 halo.

 The range value determines the difference between the longest and the shortes
 spike of the star. A value of 0 % means that all spikes have the same length,
 whereas 100 % means that the shortest spike has zero length.

 The spike width value is a factor for the width of the spikes. Higher values
 generate wider spikes.

 @{b}How are the spikes computed ?@{ub}
 The four spikes in the main directions (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) always have
 maximum length. Spikes between them (45, 135, ... degrees for example) are
 shorter and again spikes between them are shorter and so on.

 If you specify a value for random_seed, the length of the spikes is randomly
 changed.

@{b}AREXX-COMMANDS FOR SETTING ATTRIBUTES@{ub}

Every object must have a surface definition. With the following commands
you can set the attributes of a surface. First you have to define the
current surface with 'NEWSURFACE <name>'. Raystorm will set the attributes
of the new surface to default values. Every following command such as
AMBIENT or DIFFTRANS refers to the current surface and will override
the corresponding default values.

The following examples define two surfaces:

NEWSURFACE RED
AMBIENT [255,0,0]
DIFFUSE [255,0,0]

NEWSURFACE WATER
DIFFUSE [0,0,255]
REFRINDEX 1.333

@{b}Template:@{ub}
 NAME/A,TYPE/A,WRAP/A,POS/A,ALIGN/A,SIZE/A,REPEAT/S,MIRROR/S,SOFT/S,ACTOR
@{b}Arguments:@{ub}
 STRING NAME
   Filename of brush (no default).
 KEYWORD TYPE [COLOR|REFLECT|FILTER|ALTITUDE|SPECULAR]
   Type of brush (default: COLOR).
 KEYWORD WRAP [FLAT|WRAPX|WRAPY|WRAPXY]
   Brush wrapping method (default: FLAT).
 VECTOR POS
   Position (default: <0,0,0>).
 VECTOR ALIGN
   Alignment (default: <0,0,0>).
 VECTOR SIZE
   Size of brush (default: <1,1,1>).
 KEYWORD REPEAT
   If set, brush is repeated like a tile (default: OFF).
 KEYWORD MIRROR
   If set, brush is mirrord (when REPEAT is specified) (default: OFF).
 KEYWORD SOFT
   If set, brush color is interpolated softly (default: OFF).
 STRING ACTOR
   Name of actor (no default).
@{b}Description:@{ub}
 Adds a brush to surface definition. A brush is a bitmap which is wrapped
 around an  object. The specified file will be searched for in the current
 directory. If it wasn't found there and a @{"BRUSHPATH" link BRUSPATH} is given, the file will
 be searched there.
 If an error occures the command returns an error string. Supported formats
 are: IFF-ILBM, PNG, TGA, JPEG and Datatypes.

 Constants for type:
 COLOR
  Replaces the surface color of the object with the image (sets @{"DIFFUSE" link DIFFUSE} and
  @{"AMBIENT" link AMBIENT} color).
 REFLECT
  Map covers the surface and reflects environment (see @{"REFLECT" link REFLECT})).
 FILTER
  Uses the white color to pass colors and the black area to hold back color
  with a variance between two colors (like with @{"TRANSPAR" link TRANSPAR}).
 ALTITUDE
  The red values of the brush are used to give the surface an appearence of
  bumpiness.
 SPECULAR
  The rgb values set the specular color of the surface (see @{"SPECULAR" link SPECULAR}).

 Constants for wrap :
 FLAT
  The brush is projected to X-Y plane, the axis is in the middle of the
  brush area, length is the distance from the middle to the border.
 WRAPX
  The brush is wrapped around the x-axis, like on a cylinder. The left edge
  of the brush begins at the posititve X axis and wraps the brush around
  the cylinder from 'west' to 'east'.
 WRAPY
  Same as WRAPX, but wrapping is around the y-axis.
 WRAPXY
  Wrapping both: around X and Y axis. It is assumed, that the object is a
  sphere. The Y axis is the north/south pole of the spherical mapping. The
  left edge of the brush begins at the positive X axis and wraps the brush
  around the sphere from 'west' to 'east'. The brush covers the sphere
  exactly once.

@node ActorInfo " What is an Actor? "
@{b}WHAT IS AN ACTOR?@{ub}

The statement:

NEWACTOR name, position, alignment, size

defines a "virtual object" that can be associated with "real" objects,
including the Camera and  the Lights objects.  Position, alignment, and
size values are the initial values of an actor.

The object that is associated with a named actor behaves exactly like the
actor. When the actor is sized, rotated, or moved; the associted object is
sized, rotated, or moved accordingly.  It is as though the actor and the
object that is associated with it are connected by a rod.

While the coordinates of the object that is associated with an actor are
always defined in an absolute way in reference to the set world; its
movements - when associated with an actor - takes place with respect to
the coordinates of the actor.  The coordinates of the actor are defined in
the NEWACTOR statment and can have default values.

The position, alignment, and size values that follow the NEWACTOR statement
are the final values of an actor.  By defining time from and to values, a time
increment is defined by which the actor is resized, rotated, or moved from
the initial values to the final values.  By associating objects to an actor,
and rendering a picture at a particular time, or through a period of time,
animation and/or motion blur effects are achieved.

@{b}EXAMPLES@{ub}

We have included several demos in the directories 'arexx' and 'examples'
to show how to use RayStorm.

In the 'arexx' directory are examples scripts which show the usage of
RayStorm with ARexx. Start them simply by typing 'rx ???.ray' in a shell
(???.ray is the name of the script).

In the 'examples' directory are C-programs which show the usage of
RayStorm directly with a program. They can only be run from a shell.
These programs are producing a couple of pictures no animation, which must
be glued together with a utility like MainActor.

1. In the  drawer 'ARexx' of the RayStorm directory there is a file named
   'default.ray'. This is a default form for RayStorm ARexx scripts. You can
   use this form to write your own scripts.
   We'll use this file as a default for our animation script. Copy this file
   to the file 'simple.ray'. After this load the file 'simple.ray' to your
   favorite text editor (e.g GoldEd or CygnusEd).

2. To view the scene, we need a camera. Insert after the line 'address
   RAYSTORM' the line:

@{i}   '@{"SETCAMERA" link SETCAMERA} <6,1.5,-1.5> <0,0,0> <0,1,0>'@{ui}

   This sets the camera to position <6,1.5,-1.5>. The camera points to
   <0,0,0> and the view-up vector is <0,1,0>. Note that you don't have to
   specify every single parameter. Every command has default values. Refer
   to the description of a command to find out the default values.

3. Nothing can be seen without a lightsource.
   Go to the next line and type:

@{i}   '@{"POINTLIGHT" link POINTLIGHT} <0,50,0> [255,255,255] SHADOW'@{ui}

   The sphere is illuminated from above with white light.

4. Before placing the objects in the scene, you have to define their
   surfaces.
   Insert this line:

@{i}   '@{"NEWSURFACE" link NEWSURFACE} planesurf'@{ui}

   This creates a surface with name planesurf. The plane has a checkered
   surface, so insert:

@{i}   '@{"IMTEXTURE" link IMTEXTURE} /textures/checker.itx <0.1,0.1,0.1> <0,0,0> <2,2,2>'@{ui}

5. That was the plane texture. Let 's go over to sphere texture.
   Add:

@{i}   '@{"NEWSURFACE" link NEWSURFACE} spheresurf'@{ui}

   The sphere has a mirrored surface. To simulate a perfect mirror, type

@{i}   '@{"REFLECT" link REFLECT} [255,255,255]'@{ui}

6. Now we can add the objects to the scene:

@{i}   '@{"SPHERE" link SPHERE} spheresurf <0,0.5,0> 1'@{ui}

   This creates a sphere on position <0,0.5,0> and radius 1.
   Add the plane:

@{i}   '@{"PLANE" link PLANE} planesurf'@{ui}

   The default values for the position and the normal vector fit to our
   scene, so we can take them over.

7. Let's make an end to the definitions and render the scene!
   Type:

@{i}   '@{"STARTRENDER" link STARTRENDER}'@{ui}

8. Finally we may not forget to save the picture, so add:

@{i}   '@{"SAVEPIC" link SAVEPIC} simple.iff'@{ui}

   which will save the renderd picture in the current directory as a
   IFF-ILBM file.
   The last step is to free all the memory with the command 'CLEANUP'. Add:

@{i}   @{"CLEANUP" link CLEANUP}'@{ui}

9. Start the script from a shell-window with the sequence 'rx simple.ray'.
   RayStorm will now generate your picture. When RayStorm finished the work
   start your favourite viewer-program, load the file and have a look at
   it.
   Looks very monochrome!!
   To make the world colorful, we make a red checker and set the sky to
   blue. A blue sky can be done by setting the world's background color.
10. Before 'SETCAMERA' insert:

@{i}   '@{"SETWORLD" link SETWORLD} [30,30,255]'@{ui}

   Add

@{i}   '@{"DIFFUSE" link DIFFUSE} [155,0,0]'@{ui}

   to the surface planesurf (this defines one checker color), the other one
   must be set in the 'IMTEXTURE' command, so change it to

@{i}   '@{"IMTEXTURE" IMTEXTURE} /textures/checker.itx <0.1,0.1,0.1> <0,0,0> <2,2,2> 255 0 0'@{ui}

   (Note that '255 0 0' describes a color, but is not embedded in < >,
   because the checker color belongs to the texture parameters which are
   all floats.)

11. Render the scene once again, and view it.

That's the end of the tutorial! Make some changes to the scene file and
play around with the parameters to see their effects.

@node tut_bounce " Bouncing ball "
@{b}Tutorial: Bouncing ball@{ub}

The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to generate little animations.
At the end of this tutorial you'll have a animation where the earth rotates
and bounces on a rotating plane with a white checker texture on the top and
a red checker on the bottom. If you have a fast computer you can also
generate the animation with motion blur.

O.k. here we go:

1. In the  drawer 'ARexx' of the RayStorm directory there is a file named
   'default.ray'. This is a default form for RayStorm ARexx scripts. You can
   use this form to write your own scripts.
   We will use this file as a default for our animation script. Copy this file
   to the file 'bounce.ray'. After this load the file 'bounce.ray' to your
   favorite text editor (e.g GoldEd or CygnusEd).

2. First we define some values: the acceleration of the ball and the amount
   of frames to generate.
   RayStorm has three commands to set the paths where it searchs the files
   it needs. We use a brush for the surface of the ball and a texture for
   the surface of the ground.
   To do this we have to insert after the command 'ADDRESS RAYSTORM' the
   lines:

@{i}   g = .2
   frames = 17

   '@{"BRUSHPATH" link BRUSHPATH} /brushes'
   '@{"TEXTUREPATH" link TEXTUREPATH} /textures'@{ui}

   It's the same if you write the commands in upper case or lower case.
   But it's important to enclose all commans in quotes because ARexx tries
   to interpret the line before it sends it. It may happen that the line is
   changed and RayStorm don't do the things you want.

3. Next we set the screen resolution. For the first experiments we choose
   a low resolution of 160x128 pixels. Insert the line:

@{i}   '@{"SETSCREEN" link SETSCREEN} 160 128'@{ui}

4. Now we set the camera parameters. The first three values determine the
   position of the camera. We want to place it so that we can see the ball
   all over the time. The next values set the viewpoint of the camera, this
   is the point the camera aims to. The next values determine the view up
   vector. And the last two values determine the field of view. To get a
   pixel aspect of 1:1 we have to set them to 25 and 20 degree.

@{i}   '@{"SETCAMERA" link SETCAMERA} <0,10,40> <0,5,0> <0,1,0> 25 20'@{ui}

5. We want to have a bright blue background for our animation. The
   background and the global ambient color is set with the 'SETWORLD'
   command. We want to set the ambient color to a dark gray, if this color
   is to bright the scene will look washed out and the objects appear flat.
   Insert the line:

@{ui}   '@{"SETWORLD" link SETWORLD} [10,30,200] [10,10,10]'@{ui}

6. The illumination is an important part of a scene. We want to place a
   pointlight near the camera. Add the line:

@{ui}   '@{"POINTLIGHT" link POINTLIGHT} <5,10,50>'@{i}

7. Now we define the actor for the plane. We want to rotate it around the
   Z-axis. Insert the lines:

@{i}   '@{"NEWACTOR" link NEWACTOR} groundactor'
   '@{"ALIGNMENT" link ALIGNMENT} 0 ' frames+2 ' <0,0,360>'@{ui}

7. Now we define the surface for the plane and the plane itself. We make it
   a little reflective and apply a checker texture. The surface 'groundtop'
   is for the top of the plane and the surface 'groundbottom' is for the
   bottom of the surface. The plane itself consits of four triangles. Two
   fo the top and two for the bottom. Insert the lines:

@{i}   '@{"NEWSURFACE" link NEWSURFACE} groundtop'
   '@{"DIFFUSE" link DIFFUSE} [255,255,255]'
   '@{"SPECULAR" link SPECULAR} [0,0,0]'
   '@{"REFLECT" link REFLECT} [50,50,50]'
   '@{"IMTEXTURE" link IMTEXTURE} checker.itx <0,-1,0> <0,0,0> <10,10,10> ACTOR groundactor'

   '@{"NEWSURFACE" link NEWSURFACE} groundbottom'
   '@{"DIFFUSE" link DIFFUSE} [255,0,0]'
   '@{"SPECULAR" link SPECULAR} [0,0,0]'
   '@{"REFLECT" link REFLECT} [50,50,50]'
   '@{"IMTEXTURE" link IMTEXTURE} checker.itx <0,-1,0> <0,0,0> <1.5,1.5,1.5> ACTOR groundactor'

   '@{"TRIANGLE" link TRIANGLE} groundtop <-2,0,-2> <2,0,-2> <2,0,2> ACTOR groundactor'
   '@{"TRIANGLE" link TRIANGLE} groundtop <-2,0,-2> <-2,0,2> <2,0,2> ACTOR groundactor'
   '@{"TRIANGLE" link TRIANGLE} groundbottom <-2,-.01,-2> <2,-.01,-2> <2,-.01,2> ACTOR groundactor'
   '@{"TRIANGLE" link TRIANGLE} groundbottom <-2,-.01,-2> <-2,-.01,2> <2,-.01,2> ACTOR groundactor'@{ui}

8. Next we define the motion of the ball. It starts at a height of 10 and
   accelerates until it bounces on the plane, changes it's direction and
   the motions ends as the ball is back at he start point. Additional the
   ball rotates around the Y-axis. Add the following sequence to your script:

@{i}   speed = -g
   pos = 10
   '@{"NEWACTOR" link NEWACTOR} ballactor <0,'pos',0>'
   do i=0 to frames
     '@{"POSITION" link POSITION} ' i i+1 '<0,'pos',0>'
     pos = pos+speed
     if pos<=1 & speed<0 then
       speed = -speed
     else
       speed = speed-g
   end
   '@{"ALIGNMENT" link ALIGNMENT} 0 ' frames+2 ' <0,360,0>'@{ui}

9. Now we define the surface for the ball and the ball itself. The only thing
   we must do is to map a earth styled brush map to a sphere. To reach this
   goal the position of the brush must be set to the middle of the sphere
   and the size must be small enough to be completely inside the sphere.
   This are the lines to define the ball:

@{i}   '@{"NEWSURFACE" link NEWSURFACE} ball'
   '@{"BRUSH" link BRUSH} earth.iff COLOR WRAPXY <0,10,0> <0,0,0> <.1,.1,.1> ACTOR ballactor'

   '@{"SPHERE" link SPHERE} ball <0,10,0> 1 ACTOR ballactor'@{ui}

10. If your computer is fast enough you can insert the follwing lines:

@{i}   '@{"ANTIALIAS" link ANTIALIAS} 2'
   '@{"DISTRIB" link DISTRIB} 2'@{ui}

   'ANTIALIAS' improves the quality of the picture; 2 or 3 are normal values,
   higher values don't improve the quality significant.
   A value higher than one for 'DISTRIB' switches {"motion blur" link Motion_Blur} on.

11. At this the we have finished the definitions and now can render the single
   frames. If youn want the reflections of the ball on the plane you have
   to delete the keyword 'QUICK', because RayStorm renders no reflections in
   quick mode. The frame time is set with 'FROM' and 'TO'. We save the frames
   as IFF-ILBM pictures with the names 'bounce0001.iff' ... 'bounceXXXX.iff'.
   The last step is to free all the memory with the command 'CLEANUP'. Add
   these lines:

@{i}   do i=0 to frames
      '@{"STARTRENDER" link STARTRENDER} QUICK FROM 'i' TO 'i+1
      '@{"SAVEPIC" link SAVEPIC} bounce' || RIGHT(i,4,0) || '.iff'
   end

   '@{"CLEANUP" link CLEANUP}'@{ui}

12. Start the script from a shell-window with the sequence 'rx bounce.ray'.
   RayStorm will now generate your frames. When RayStorm finished the work
   you must glue the pictures together to get the animation.

That's all. Have fun!
@endnode

@node tut_mblur " Motion blur "
@{b}Tutorial: Motion blur@{ub}

In this tutorial we show you how to make animations and how to use motion
blur.
To animate objects we need ACTORs. An ACTOR can be seen as a virtual object
which can have a certain position/alignment/size at a certain time. ACTORs can
be used for keyframe animation by giving control points which RayStorm can
interpolate (only linear for now.  Spline interpolations will be implemented
later).
You can assign an ACTOR to one or more real objects. An object with an actor
assigned to it will follow all actions the actor does. Let's take the sphere
from the second tutorial and move it to direction of the camera.
Type following:

@{i}'@{"SETCAMERA" link SETCAMERA} <6,1.5,-1.5> <0,0,0><0,1,0>'
'@{"POINTLIGHT" link POINTLIGHT} <30,50,30> [255,255,255] SHADOW'@{ui}

you can add POSITION, ALIGNMENT and SIZE commands after NEWACTOR
(similar to the surface commands after NEWSURFACE)

@{i}'@{"NEWACTOR" link NEWACTOR} actor'
'@{"POSITION" link POSITION} 0 5 <3,0,0.4>'

'@{"NEWSURFACE" link NEWSURFACE} planesurf'
'@{"DIFFUSE" link DIFFUSE} [255,30,30]'
'@{"IMTEXTURE" link IMTEXTURE} "checker.itx" <0.1,0.1,0.1> <0,0,0> <2,2,2> 155 25 0'

'@{"NEWSURFACE" link NEWSURFACE} spheresurf'
'@{"REFLECT" link REFLECT} [255,255,255]'

'@{"SPHERE" link SPHERE} spheresurf <0,1,0> 0.7 actor'
'@{"PLANE" link PLANE} planesurf'@{ui}

You can make an animation by a series of STARTRENDER/SAVEPIC combinations. Our
little movie shall consist of 6 frames, so we will subdivide our time intervall
(1 unit) and make a photo every 0.2 time units. The STARTRENDER command has the
option to render a picture within a certain time intervall. That can be
compared with the shutter time of a real camera. The camera of RayStorm records
all movements of the objects in the scene within that time intervall which
results in a blurred scene. At the beginning we do no motion blur, so we set
the start and the end time to the same value. (Which means no shutter time).

Add this code and execute it:

@{i}do i=0 to 5
 '@{"STARTRENDER" link STARTRENDER} QUICK FROM 'i' TO 'i
 '@{"SAVEPIC" link SAVEPIC} sphere' || RIGHT(i,4,0) || '.iff'
end

'@{"CLEANUP" link CLEANUP}'@{ui}

You can make a movie out of it using an animator program such as MainActor.
Now we introduce one of the advanced features of RayStorm: Motion Blur
Replace the commands above by the following lines:

@{i}/* when doing motion blur you *MUST* add the distrib command +/

'@{"DISTRIB" link DISTRIB} 3'

/* shutter time is 1 */

do i=0 to 5
 '@{"STARTRENDER" link STARTRENDER} QUICK FROM 'i' TO 'i+1
 '@{"SAVEPIC" link SAVEPIC} sphere' || RIGHT(i,4,0) || '.iff'
end

'@{"CLEANUP" link CLEANUP}'@{ui}

For each frame, the camera opens the shutter 0.2 time units long and records
what's happening. As you can see, an animation with motion blur gives a better
visual effect.
Again feel free to change the parameters.
